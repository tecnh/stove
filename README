= Introduction

Stove is a tool to help Chef users, especially those who may be running many different instances of Chef or who are supporting a wide number of Chef users. It makes it easy for new users to setup their Chef environments, and for Head Chefs switch between multiple organizations. It also allows for easy storage of defaults on a per org per user basis.

= Features

- uses databags to get aws keys
- allows you to easily switch between orgs
- tools for creating amis [ssh in afterwards and clears out the crap]
- installs .chef in your home folder automatically
- pulls down .pem key (with correct password?)
- warns which org you are in
- defaults (region, az, etc.)
- deploy & undeploy commands
- create vpc & rds instances?
